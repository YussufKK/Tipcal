## function calcTip(bill) return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.20; why we used this command 
we used coman above he calcTip function calculates the tip amount based on the provided bill amount. It uses a ternary operator to check if the bill falls within the range of $50 to $300. If it does, it calculates a 15% tip; otherwise, it calculates a 20% tip. This approach provides a concise and efficient way to determine the tip amount according to specific tipping rules.
